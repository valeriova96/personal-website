              A project developed for the Machine Learning course. We were given
              a dataset containing a lot of different functions written as a
              Json file. Our goal was to develop a classification algorithm
              tailored on a part of such dataset. In order to achieve the
              objective I took advantage of ID3 and SVMs. I used Python language
              within the Google Colab environment and many ML famous libraries
              such as TensorFlow, SickitLearn, Pandas, and many others.

              Another project developed for the Machine Learning course. Here we
              were given a dataset containing images of typical stuff that can
              be found in a domestic environment (juice cartons, glasses of
              water, plastic food containers, ...). We had to build up a
              Convolutional Neural Network able to recognize new samples of such
              categories. I used the same language, environment and ,more or
              less, the same libraries of the project above.

              Iceberg Jump is a mobile multiplatform game developed with Corona
              tool and Lua langauge. It can be classified as an endless run. The
              user goal then, is trying to collect the highest possible score.
              It can be also achieved by collecting delicious ice-creams! (If
              you want to watch a demo, click the image on the left).

              This whole website you're visiting now is created with my bare
              hands. I writed every single line of code, spaced every block,
              text and image that you can find here. The job has been
              accomplished by using the saint web-developer trinity: HTML, CSS
              and a pinch of JavaScript
